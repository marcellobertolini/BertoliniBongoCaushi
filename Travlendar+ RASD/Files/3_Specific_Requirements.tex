\mysubsubsection{User Interfaces}
The following mockups represent an idea of the interfaces that will be provided to the user.
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength{\leftskip}{1cm}
	\item \textbf{Login}
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Login}
				\caption{Login Sketch}
			\end{figure}
			\newpage
	\item \textbf{User Profile}\\
			\vspace{0cm}\\
			The user will have a personal page in which he will be able to customize his preferences to fit the application to his needs. He will be able to add tags (see “tag creation”), to edit the lunch section, to select the means of transport, he would like the system to use in its computations, and he will also be able to insert his personal season ticket in the homonym field. 
			The system will warn the user with a notification when it is next to the expiry date. 
			\begin{figure}[H]

				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/User_Profile}
				\caption{User Profile Sketch}
			\end{figure}
	\item \textbf{Event Creation and Trip Planning}\\
			\vspace{0cm}\\
			The user will be able to add an event characterized by a tag icon, which contains the user’s preferences regarding the means of transport and other settings (see “tag creation”).
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Event_Creation_1}
				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Event_Creation_2}
				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Event_Creation_3}
				\caption{Event Creation Sketch}
			\end{figure}
			As shown above the system will suggest the best options to reach the event. If the event is not reachable a warning is displayed.\\
			Otherwise, if the event is not located in the user’s area, the system will suggest the creation of a trip helping the user to book the tickets to reach the desired town.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Trip_1}
				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Trip_2}
				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Trip_3}
				\caption{Trip Sketch}
			\end{figure}
			If the user wants to plan a trip in advance or in the case he has already planned one, he will be able to add it in the same way he would create an event.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Plan_Trip_1}
				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Plan_Trip_2}
				\caption{Plan Trip and Trips Sketch}
			\end{figure}
			\newpage
	\item \textbf{Tag Settings}\\
			\vspace{0cm}\\
			In this section the user will be able to create a tag containing a list of the means of transport that can be enabled. It’ll be present another field called “anticipation time” that will be used by the system during the computation of the routes.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Tag}
				\caption{Tag Sketch}
			\end{figure}
	\item \textbf{Event View}\\
			\vspace{0cm}\\
			The user will be able to review his appointments in the calendar section. An arrow will connect each meeting, colored of yellow, in presence of bad weather and strikes, blue when the conditions are optimal.
			\begin{figure}[H]

				\hspace{0.5cm}
				\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Images/Sketch/Event_View_2}

\vspace{0.5cm}\\
\indent \textbf{Hardware Limitations}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\leftskip}{0.5cm}
	\item Mobile App

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Performance}\par
\vspace{0.2cm}
The system has to be able to respond to a great number of simultaneously user requests in order to give the best route in the shortest time possible. In order to obtain the best performances, the computation will be provided by an external service.
\newpage

\indent \textbf{Reliability}
\vspace{0.2cm}\par
The system must guarantee a 24/7 service. The information must be stored in a cloud database in order to be always available to the user when required.
\vspace{0.5cm}\\

\indent \textbf{Scalability}
\vspace{0.2cm}\par
Due to the continuous enlargement of the sharing companies and the new way of traveling, the system has to guarantee a high level of scalability in order to be upgradable.
\vspace{0.5cm}\\

\indent \textbf{Security}
\vspace{0.2cm}\par

\vspace{0.5cm}\\

\indent \textbf{Accuracy}
\vspace{0.2cm}\par
The information, such as the sharing positions and routes provided by the system, must be as accurate as possible.
