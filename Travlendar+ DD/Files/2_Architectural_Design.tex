\mysubsection{Overview}
In this chapter we will analyze the proposed architecture and components of the Travlendar+ system.\par
The proposed architecture has three tiers :
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\leftskip}{0.5cm}
	\item \emph{Presentation Tier : }represented by Browser and Mobile App. It's how the system shows himself to the user.
	\item \emph{Presentation Tier : }represented by Web Server, which contains javascript and html code in order to create dynamic pages, and Application Server, which contains all the system's logic.
	\item \emph{Database Tier : }represented by DB Server, that contains and manages persistent data in an efficient way.
\end{itemize}
